CLASS

- WorkOrderPDFGenerator > Launches using the flow mentioned below. Generates a PDF using the pages/WorkOrderLabel.page 
as a template. Attaching it to the WorkOrder

FLOWS 

- Work_Order_Create_Pickup_Label - Calls the apex above when the Create_Pickup_Label is checked. This is set to run 
this on create or update of the WorkOrder.

LWC

- When there is a ContentVersion ID on the record, held in Pickup_Label_ContentVersion__c, it will give the option 
to open the label (aka PDF). This will open in the native app for the device, providing access to print controls. If
there is no ContentVersion ID in the field, then the component shows a button to generate one. This updates the
Create_Pickup_Label__c field to true, which forces the flow to run. 

- FormFactor Settings have been applied to the LWC Component to allow Salesforce mobile apps to render the component.

PAGES 

- HTML Template for the PDF to be generated. This is attached to the standard controller for WorkOrder so it will have 
access to the fields on WorkOrder and can be updated to reflect the required template.
